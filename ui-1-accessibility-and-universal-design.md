## Challenge introduction

Understanding how to design for all people is essential for any designer. Everyone should be able to access information on the web in an easy and efficient way. It’s not just the right thing to do it is a potential financial liability. MIT and Harvard have recently been sued by the the National Association for the Deaf for failing to meet the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act by not including closed captions in the online courses. Companies that don’t take the needs of the disables seriously are facing great financial costs.

‘According to the[ Center for Universal Design (CUD)](http://www.ncsu.edu/ncsu/design/cud/pubs_p/docs/poster.pdf) at North Carolina State University, "is the design of products and environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design".’ From [Washington.edu](http://www.washington.edu/doit/universal-design-process-principles-and-applications)

‘**Accessible design** is a design process in which the needs of people with disabilities are specifically considered. *Accessibility* sometimes refers to the characteristic that products, services, and facilities can be independently used by people with a variety of disabilities. Accessibility as a design concern has a long history, but public awareness about accessibility increased with the passage of legislation such as the[ Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)](http://www.ada.gov/), which mandated that public facilities and services be fully accessible to people with disabilities.’ From [Washington.edu](http://www.washington.edu/doit/what-difference-between-accessible-usable-and-universal-design)

## Challenge outline

Design a registration form for SuperDuper Corp’s upcoming event keeping the principles of universal and accessibly design in mind. Also provide the option to register for SuperDuper.com by creating a username and password. The form must include:

### 1. Introductory text:

"Register for our amazing event! Fill out this form to register for our event. We’ll reserve your spot and email you a confirmation."

### 2. Form Elements:

* First Name (Required)

* Last Name (Required)

* Address  (Optional)

* Country (Required)

* Zip Code (Required)

* Email (Required)

* Sex (Required)

    * Male, female, other, prefer not to say

* Language (Required)

    * English, Spanish, French, Other

* User ID (Optional)

    * 5-12 characters A-Z

* Password (Required if User ID is filled in)

    * 7-12 characters

    * Aa-Bb, must include one numerical 0-9. no special characters

* Comments (Optional)

### 3. A button to submit the information

Also, SuperDuper wants to make sure this form fits in with the look and feel of their site in addition to being universal and accessibly.

## Recommended process

First, take a look at the Background listed above. I have provided the frame of [SuperDuper’s](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/mwxf7n9flr4dj4u/AABjmGjFyI0xNij5mE0cpz5Ga?dl=0) website (Header, Body, Footer) as both a Sketch document and png. Your may use whatever software you are most comfortable with but I recommend Sketch. If you don’t know it, you should learn it (it’s easy) and this is a good opportunity. If you’re stuck check out how things work on some websites you like, take a look at the FTS Base UI Kit for help, or ask for tips from the FTS staff.

## Deliverables

1. A full UI kit including each form element. Make sure you’re using the best form element for each type of information. Consider default, hover, active, error and disabled states for each element. Include states for each element that you think are necessary for universal and accessible design. Be prepared to defend your decisions.

2. A fully designed page with the form and 1-2 additional pages illustrating different states as a user might encounter them.

## Timeline

You’ll have just under two weeks to complete your work. The challenge starts on a Monday and is due for evaluation by Trish Dallmeyer or Steve Hickey the following Thursday. We highly recommend checking in several times with members of the design team along the way. There will not be any project extensions, you are responsible for delivering on time. Part of delivering on time is making sure you’re on the correct path at several intervals along the way.

Your brief talk will be due for presentation the day after the challenge is due.
